# Custom SVG Diagrams Created - Complete

## Summary

Created 4 high-quality, purpose-built SVG diagrams for key strategic foresight methodologies. All diagrams are educational, self-contained, and licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.

## Diagrams Created

### 1. Futures Triangle Framework
**File:** `/public/diagrams/futures-triangle.svg`  
**Methodology:** Futures Triangle (Sohail Inayatullah, 2008)  
**Size:** ~7 KB  

**Features:**
- Clear visualization of three forces: Pull (aspirations), Push (trends), Weight (barriers)
- Color-coded arrows and labels (Pull=teal, Push=orange, Weight=gray)
- Central "Plausible Futures" zone showing tension between forces
- Example boxes for each force with real-world examples
- Clean, educational design with proper attribution

**Educational Value:**
- Helps users immediately grasp the three-force dynamic
- Examples ground abstract concepts (AI acceleration, vested interests, sustainable world)
- Shows how plausible futures emerge from force interactions

### 2. PESTLE/STEEP Framework
**File:** `/public/diagrams/pestle-framework.svg`  
**Methodology:** Environmental Scanning  
**Size:** ~12 KB  

**Features:**
- Six domain boxes around central organization/issue circle
- Color-coded domains: Political (red), Economic (blue), Social (purple), Technological (teal), Legal (orange), Environmental (green)
- Each domain includes description and examples
- Arrows showing information flow from domains to center
- Note explaining STEEP variant

**Educational Value:**
- Comprehensive view of all scanning domains
- Concrete examples in each domain (climate policy, recession, remote work, AI, privacy laws, carbon neutrality)
- Visual metaphor of environmental forces surrounding an organization

### 3. Cross-Impact Analysis Matrix
**File:** `/public/diagrams/cross-impact-matrix.svg`  
**Methodology:** Cross-Impact Analysis (Gordon & Helmer, 1966)  
**Size:** ~21 KB  

**Features:**
- Full 8×8 matrix with real drivers (AI, Climate, Demographics, Energy, Trade, Tech, Urban, Health)
- Color-coded impact strength: High (red), Medium (orange), Low (blue), Minimal (gray), Self (black)
- Comprehensive legend explaining how to read the matrix
- Three worked insights showing practical application
- Detailed axis labels showing FROM (rows) and ON (columns) logic

**Educational Value:**
- Demonstrates actual cross-impact methodology, not just theory
- Shows feedback loops (e.g., "AI impacts Climate, Climate impacts Energy, Energy impacts AI")
- Teaches matrix reading skills essential for systems thinking
- Insights section translates matrix to strategic implications

### 4. Morphological Box - Future of Work
**File:** `/public/diagrams/morphological-box.svg`  
**Methodology:** Morphological Analysis (Fritz Zwicky Method)  
**Size:** ~17 KB  

**Features:**
- 6 parameters × 20 total options = 5,120 possible combinations
- Color-coded cells for visual variety and comprehension
- Red dashed pathway showing example scenario selection
- Parameters: Employment Type, Work Location, Skill Development, Income Model, Social Safety Net, Career Pattern
- Insights box explaining the example pathway and total combinations

**Educational Value:**
- Shows systematic exploration of solution space
- Concrete "Future of Work" application everyone can relate to
- Example pathway demonstrates how to navigate the morphological field
- Calculation (5×4×4×4×4×4 = 5,120) teaches combinatorial logic

## Integration with Mind Map Data

All diagrams added to `mindMapData.js` as first media item for their respective methodologies:

1. **Futures Triangle** → `id: 'futures-triangle'` (line ~340)
2. **PESTLE/STEEP** → `id: 'env-scanning'` (line ~727)
3. **Cross-Impact Matrix** → `id: 'cross-impact'` (line ~2498)
4. **Morphological Box** → `id: 'morphological'` (line ~2191)

## Build Status

✓ Build successful: 1.09 MB (309 KB gzipped)  
✓ No errors  
✓ All diagrams accessible via `/diagrams/*.svg` paths

## Design Principles Used

### Accessibility:
- High contrast colors
- Clear typography (Arial, sans-serif)
- Descriptive labels and legends
- Sufficient font sizes (10-24px)

### Educational Value:
- Self-contained explanations
- Real-world examples
- Visual hierarchy (headers → diagrams → insights)
- Attribution to original methodology creators

### Technical Quality:
- Clean SVG code
- Scalable vector format (looks good at any size)
- Small file sizes (7-21 KB)
- Browser-compatible (standard SVG 1.1)

## Licensing

Each diagram includes footer attribution

## Impact

**Before:**
- 4 methodologies needed key framework diagrams
- Relied on external Wikimedia Commons images (when available)
- Some diagrams missing entirely

**After:**
- 4 custom, purpose-built educational diagrams
- Diagrams specifically designed for foresight education
- Consistent visual language across all diagrams
- Total media items: 132 (up from 128)

## Remaining Diagram Opportunities

Medium priority diagrams that could still be created:
- Weak Signals detection framework
- Signal strength vs. time curve
- Emerging Issues lifecycle
- Wild Card probability × impact matrix
- Strauss-Howe generational cycle
- Three Horizons framework
- Strategic Issue lifecycle

Lower priority (methodologies have adequate media):
- Scenario Planning 2×2 examples
- CLA iceberg visualization
- Delphi process flow
- Backcasting timeline

## Next Steps

Custom diagram creation complete for high-priority gaps. Options:

1. Create medium-priority diagrams (7 more)
2. Enrich remaining 7 methodologies to museum quality
3. Content polish pass on existing enriched methodologies
4. User testing and feedback collection
5. Deploy and share for wider audience testing
