  // SEGMENT 0: Opening
  '00-intro-wide': `Welcome, fellow explorer of possible futures.

Before you lies not merely a visualization, but a cosmos of methodologies—
eighteen distinct approaches to understanding what comes next.

The future, you see, is not a place we're traveling to.
It's a landscape we're actively constructing,
one decision, one assumption, one paradigm at a time.

What you're witnessing is the architecture of foresight itself.`,

  // SEGMENT 1: Strategic Foresight Center
  '01-strategic-foresight': `This is Strategic Foresight.

Not fortune-telling. Not prediction.
But rather, a disciplined framework for expanding our peripheral vision
across the possibility space of what might emerge.

It's the difference between being surprised by the future,
and being prepared to shape it.

At its core, foresight asks three fundamental questions:
What is probable? What is possible? And what is preferable?`,

  // SEGMENT 2: Six Pillars Overview
  '02-six-pillars': `Surrounding the center, you see six pillars.

This framework was developed by Professor Sohail Inayatullah,
one of the most influential futures scholars of our time.

Each pillar represents a different cognitive mode,
a different way of engaging with uncertainty.

Together, they form a complete system—
from mapping our current assumptions,
to transforming our preferred futures into reality.

Let's explore each one.`,

  // SEGMENT 3: Mapping
  '03-mapping': `The first pillar: Mapping the Future.

Before we can change the future, we must first understand
how we currently think about it.

What assumptions are we making?
What mental models guide our decisions?
What do we believe is inevitable, and what do we believe is impossible?

Mapping reveals the often invisible frameworks
that constrain our imagination.

It's the essential first step in any foresight practice.`,

  // SEGMENT 4: Futures Triangle
  '04-futures-triangle': `Consider the Futures Triangle, developed by Inayatullah himself.

It maps three forces that shape every future:

The Push of the Present—the momentum of current trends.
Deep drivers like demographic shifts, technological trajectories.

The Pull of the Future—our aspirations and visions.
What we hope to create, what we're actively building toward.

And the Weight of the Past—our mental models, our institutions,
the accumulated inertia of how things have always been done.

The future emerges at the intersection of these three forces.
Understanding their interplay is the beginning of agency.`,

  // SEGMENT 5: Anticipating
  '05-anticipating': `The second pillar: Anticipating Change.

If mapping shows us where we stand,
anticipating shows us what's approaching on the horizon.

This is the practice of peripheral vision—
detecting the weak signals, the emerging patterns,
the early tremors of transformation
before they become earthquakes.

The organizations that thrive aren't those that react fastest.
They're the ones who saw the change coming
when it was still just a whisper.`,

  // SEGMENT 6: Environmental Scanning
  '06-env-scanning': `Environmental Scanning is systematic vigilance.

Imagine radar sweeping across the landscape of change—
monitoring technologies, societies, economies, environments.

The scanning process looks for:
Trends that are accelerating.
Wild cards that could disrupt everything.
And most crucially, those weak signals—
faint indicators of possible futures that haven't crystallized yet.

Dator's Law applies here: Any useful statement about the future
should at first appear ridiculous.

The future always arrives from the periphery.`,

  // SEGMENT 7: Timing
  '07-timing': `The third pillar: Timing the Future.

Futures don't arrive randomly.
They emerge in patterns, rhythms, cycles.

Understanding macro-historical patterns—
the rise and fall of civilizations,
the punctuated equilibrium of technological revolutions,
the generational cycles that repeat across centuries—

This temporal awareness transforms foresight
from speculation into navigation.

We're not passive observers of time.
We're participants in its unfolding patterns.`,

  // SEGMENT 8: Deepening
  '08-deepening': `The fourth pillar: Deepening Understanding.

Now we descend below the surface.

Most futures work focuses on trends and data—the visible layer.
But beneath every trend lies a worldview.
Beneath every worldview lies a myth.

Deepening methods ask:
What assumptions make this future seem natural or inevitable?
What cultural narratives support it?
What deeper story is being told?

To change the future, we must change the story.`,

  // SEGMENT 9: Causal Layered Analysis
  '09-cla': `Causal Layered Analysis—CLA—is Inayatullah's most powerful tool.

It examines any issue at four levels:

The Litany: headlines, surface events, reactive noise.

Social Causes: systemic factors, structures, economic and political forces.

Worldview: ideological frameworks, cultural assumptions,
the paradigms that make certain futures seem rational.

And finally, Myth and Metaphor: the deep unconscious,
the archetypes and narratives that shape civilization itself.

Surface solutions address the litany.
Transformative solutions address the myth.

CLA doesn't just analyze problems.
It reveals the epistemological foundations that created them.`,

  // SEGMENT 10: Creating Alternatives
  '10-creating': `The fifth pillar: Creating Alternatives.

Here, we step from analysis into imagination.

One future is a prediction.
Multiple futures are preparation.

The methods in this pillar generate diverse scenarios—
not to predict which will happen,
but to stretch our collective imagination
beyond the single expected path.

The future isn't singular.
It's plural, probabilistic, participatory.

By creating alternative futures, we expand the range
of what we're prepared to encounter.`,

  // SEGMENT 11: Scenario Planning
  '11-scenarios': `Scenario Planning emerged at RAND in the fifties,
but was perfected at Royal Dutch Shell in the seventies.

When Shell's planners asked "What if oil prices collapse?"
it seemed absurd. Oil had only ever risen.

But they built the scenario anyway.
When the 1973 oil crisis hit, Shell was the only major oil company
that had mentally rehearsed that future.

They thrived while competitors scrambled.

Scenarios aren't predictions.
They're wind tunnels for testing strategies
against multiple plausible futures.

The goal isn't accuracy.
It's preparedness, resilience, strategic flexibility.`,

  // SEGMENT 12: Transforming
  '12-transforming': `The sixth pillar: Transforming the Future.

This is where foresight becomes action.

We've mapped our assumptions.
We've anticipated emerging change.
We've deepened our understanding.
We've imagined alternatives.

Now: How do we create the future we actually want?

Transformation isn't about predicting the future.
It's about committing to one—
and then building the pathway to reach it.`,

  // SEGMENT 13: Backcasting
  '13-backcasting': `Backcasting inverts the planning process.

Traditional forecasting asks:
Given where we are, where will we end up?

Backcasting asks:
Given where we want to be, how do we get there?

You start with a vision of a preferred future—
not what's likely, but what's desirable.

Then you work backward, identifying
the decisions, innovations, and transformations
required to make that future real.

It's how Sweden planned to eliminate fossil fuels.
It's how we designed the pathway to the moon.

Backcasting is how impossible futures become inevitable ones.`,

  // SEGMENT 14: Closing
  '14-closing': `You've now journeyed through the Six Pillars of Foresight.

But this isn't merely an intellectual framework.
It's a practice, a discipline, a way of engaging with radical uncertainty.

The future will arrive whether we think about it or not.
The question is: Will we be conscious participants in its creation,
or passive recipients of someone else's vision?

Every methodology you've seen here is a tool for agency—
for expanding what we believe is possible,
and for building what we believe is preferable.

The future is not something we enter.
The future is something we create.

Thank you for exploring with us.
Now, go forth and practice foresight.`,

  // QUICK TOUR SCRIPTS (abbreviated versions)
  'quick-intro': `Welcome to Strategic Foresight—
a disciplined approach to exploring alternative futures.
What you see before you are eighteen methodologies,
organized into six pillars.
Let's take a brief tour through this landscape of possibility.`,

  'quick-pillars': `The Six Pillars framework, developed by Sohail Inayatullah,
organizes foresight methods into six modes:
Mapping current assumptions, Anticipating change,
Timing patterns, Deepening understanding,
Creating alternatives, and Transforming futures.
Each pillar offers unique tools for navigating uncertainty.`,

  'quick-scenarios': `Scenario Planning is perhaps the most famous foresight method.
Developed at RAND and perfected at Shell,
it creates multiple plausible futures—
not to predict which will happen,
but to prepare for whichever does.
Organizations that practice scenario planning
don't just react to change. They're ready for it.`,

  'quick-close': `You've glimpsed the landscape of Strategic Foresight.
