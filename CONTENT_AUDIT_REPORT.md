## 5. Priority Action Items

### IMMEDIATE (Fix Before Next Push)

**1. Fix Critical Overview: Strategic Issue Management** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- This is fully enriched (4,018 words) but overview shows only 6 words
- Likely data corruption or parsing issue
- ACTION: Verify overview field integrity

**2. Expand 7 Short Overviews** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- CLA, Discourse Analysis, Scenarios, Delphi, Visioning, Backcasting, Aspirational Futures
- Each needs 50-100 words minimum
- ACTION: Write descriptive overviews

**3. Expand 11 Short Descriptions** (LOW PRIORITY)
- Node labels under 8 words
- These show on hover and in UI
- ACTION: Rewrite to 10-15 words each

### FUTURE (Enrichment Pipeline)

**Phase 1: Complete Partial Enrichments** (5 methodologies)
- CLA, Scenarios, Delphi, Visioning, Backcasting
- Add processGuide + workedExample to each
- Estimate: 1,000-1,500 words each

**Phase 2: Full Enrichment** (2 methodologies)
- Discourse Analysis, Aspirational Futures
- Add processGuide + workedExample + caseStudies
- Estimate: 1,500-2,000 words each

## 7. Recommendations

### DO NOW (Before Next Commit)
1. ✅ Investigate Strategic Issue Management overview (6 words is suspicious)
2. ✅ Expand 7 critical overviews to 75+ words
3. ✅ Rewrite 11 short descriptions to 10-15 words

### DO NEXT (Content Enrichment Phase)
4. Complete 5 partial enrichments (add processGuide + workedExample)
5. Full enrichment for 2 remaining methodologies
6. Add more diagrams for partially enriched methodologies

### DO LATER (Polish)
7. Add audio/podcast links if available
8. Source additional case studies for all methodologies
9. Create more custom diagrams for complex concepts

## 8. Stability Note

**IMPORTANT:** Per previous directive "content + stability is paramount":
- All link validation passed ✅
- Browser crash protection active (MAX_TOTAL_NODES = 250) ✅
- No data corruption detected ✅
- Safe to proceed with content fixes ✅

Only the Strategic Issue Management overview anomaly needs investigation - possible rendering issue vs. actual data problem.
